# Flask Image Upload

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to upload images and then displays the uploaded image's name and content on a separate page.

## Project Structure


- `/static/uploads`: This directory will store the uploaded images.
- `/templates`: This directory contains HTML templates for the web pages.
- `app.py`: The main Flask application script.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the code.

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install Flask

cd flask_image_upload

python app.py
